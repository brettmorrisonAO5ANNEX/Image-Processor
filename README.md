# Image.(in): A Basic Image Processing Application

## *What Does Image.(in) Do?*

Taking pictures is cool, but sometimes reality
just isn't as interesting as one would have hoped...
that's where Image.(in) comes in! Image.(in) is intended to
be a basic image processing application that allows
users manipulate a locally stored image by adding different
color filters/editors.

## *Who Will Use It?*

- **recreational photographers** who want to warp reality with
  their pictures
- **social media users** looking for a cool way to
  spice up their photos
- **coding enthusiasts** who want to learn more about
  image manipulation
- **photo/video editors** looking to intrigue their
  clients with new visual art styles

## *Why Image.(in) Interests Me:*

From self-driving cars to mobile applications,
computer software has many uses. However,
its artistic applications can easily go less appreciated.
I recently became interested in video editing
and, in the process, have discovered wonderful applications
such as Apple's Final Cut Pro, which combine software with
human creativity to manipulate videos and images
in exciting ways! Exploring a basic image processing
application will allow me to gain a better understanding of
software development in the context of an industry that I have
a personal interest in!

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking
the ***new project*** button and filling out the required fields (name must match "image4U"
where the number can be any digit and the capital letter must be from the English
alphabet), then you can ***add a filter*** by clicking the add filter button and choosing
the desired filter. Changes can be viewed in the history panel in the right of the tool menu panel.
- You can generate the second required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking
either the ***undo*** or ***undo all*** buttons which will update which filters are added the image.
Changes can be viewed in the history panel in the right of the tool menu
- You can locate my visual component by either looking at the top of each panel
at the indicative logo/icon or by pressing ***process project*** to see the final
product of your edit (best view if you choose yes to "randomize color?" before
processing).
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the ***save progress*** button in the
tool menu panel.
- You can reload the state of my application by choosing the desired project
from the dropdown ***\<options>*** and clicking the load button to the right.
