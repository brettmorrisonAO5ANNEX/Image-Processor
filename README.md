# Image.(in): A Basic Image Processing Application

## *What Does Image.(in) Do?*

Taking pictures is cool, but sometimes reality 
just isn't as interesting as one would have hoped... 
that's where Image.(in) comes in! Image.(in) is intended to 
be a basic image processing application that allows 
users manipulate a locally stored image by adding different
color filters/editors.  

## *Who Will Use It?*
- **recreational photographers** who want to warp reality with 
their pictures
- **social media users** looking for a cool way to 
spice up their photos
- **coding enthusiasts** who want to learn more about 
image manipulation
- **photo/video editors** looking to intrigue their 
clients with new visual art styles

## *Why Image.(in) Interests Me:*
From self-driving cars to mobile applications,
computer software has many uses. However,
its artistic applications can easily go less appreciated. 
I recently became interested in video editing 
and, in the process, have discovered wonderful applications
such as Apple's Final Cut Pro, which combine software with
human creativity to manipulate videos and images 
in exciting ways! Exploring a basic image processing 
application will allow me to gain a better understanding of 
software development in the context of an industry that I have
a personal interest in!
